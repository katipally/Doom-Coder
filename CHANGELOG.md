## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Auto-Dim was completely non-functional on Apple Silicon Macs** — The previous implementation used `IODisplayGetFloatParameter` / `IODisplaySetFloatParameter` (IOKit display API), which returns zero services on Apple Silicon. Replaced with `CGGetDisplayTransferByFormula` / `CGSetDisplayTransferByFormula` (CoreGraphics gamma table API), which works on all Macs. Screen now visibly dims to the selected level after the idle timeout and instantly restores on any mouse or keyboard activity.
- **Timers didn't fire reliably** — Changed all internal timers (`Timer.scheduledTimer`) to use `RunLoop.main.add(t, forMode: .common)` so they fire in `.common` mode instead of `.default`, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Auto-Dim Settings submenu headers were broken** — `Text()` inside a SwiftUI `Menu` renders as a disabled menu item, not a section header. Replaced with proper `Section("Idle Timeout")` and `Section("Dim Level")` for correct macOS menu appearance.
- **Idle detection missed mouse clicks and scrolling** — Added `leftMouseDown`, `rightMouseDown`, and `scrollWheel` event types to the idle check, preventing false-positive dimming when clicking without moving the mouse.
- **Mode picker was confusing** — Replaced bullet-character radio buttons with a clear `Mode` submenu with descriptions for each option.
- **Added gamma safety net** — `CGDisplayRestoreColorSyncSettings()` is now called on app exit/crash via `deinit`, ensuring the display gamma is always restored even if the app exits unexpectedly while screen is dimmed.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Auto-Dim Mode** — new mode that automatically dims the screen after configurable idle time (2, 5, or 10 minutes) and instantly restores brightness on mouse/keyboard activity. Protects against display burn-in during long unattended sessions.
- **Configurable dim level** — choose minimum brightness: 5%, 10%, or 20% when auto-dim activates.
- **Thermal monitoring** — real-time system thermal state displayed in the menu (🟢 Normal / 🟡 Fair / 🟠 Serious / 🔴 Critical). Zero overhead — notification-driven via `ProcessInfo.thermalState`.
- **Session timer** — optional auto-disable after 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours with countdown display in the menu. Prevents accidentally leaving the Mac awake overnight.
- **Custom app icon** — Doom Coder now has its own logo (skeleton vibe-coding with headphones).
- **Mode picker in menu** — switch between Full Mode (screen always on at full brightness) and Auto-Dim Mode.
- **Settings persist** across app restarts via UserDefaults (mode, idle timeout, dim level, session timer).

### Changed
- About window now shows the app icon and updated feature description.
- Menu structure redesigned with mode picker, settings submenus, and thermal/timer displays.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **App failed to launch (dyld crash)** — Added `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement. Hardened runtime's Library Validation requires all loaded code to share the same Team ID, which is impossible with ad-hoc signing. This entitlement allows the embedded Sparkle framework to load correctly.
- **Proper bottom-up code signing** — Replaced deprecated `codesign --deep` with individual component signing in the correct order: XPC services → Sparkle helpers → Sparkle framework → main app (with entitlements). Each binary includes `--options runtime` for hardened runtime.
- **Accurate Gatekeeper instructions** — Updated README and release notes with correct macOS Sequoia (15+) / macOS 26 instructions. Right-click bypass no longer works; users must use System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.
- **Synced local project version** — Info.plist now matches the release version (0.1.2).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **"App is damaged" error on macOS 14+** — CI now properly ad-hoc signs the app bundle and all nested Sparkle components (XPCServices, Autoupdate helper, Updater.app) using `codesign --force --deep --sign -`. Previously the build had `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` which produced a completely unsigned binary that macOS 14+ rejects as "damaged".
- Updated installation instructions in README to include the `xattr -cr` Terminal method (works on all macOS versions) alongside the right-click method.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Initial release 🎉
- Menu bar icon (`⚡` when active, `⚡/` when inactive) — no Dock icon, lives purely in the menu bar
- Toggle to enable/disable sleep prevention with a single click
- Elapsed time display ("Active for 2h 34m") when Doom Coder is running
- Prevents both **display sleep** and **system sleep** using `IOPMAssertionTypePreventUserIdleDisplaySleep` — zero CPU overhead, kernel-level flag
- Sparkle auto-update support — "Check for Updates..." in the menu
- About window with version info
- Launch at login support (requires app to be in `/Applications`)
- Targets macOS 14+ (Sonoma and later)
